For each feature you want added create a page snapshot with the addon Single File ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/singlefile/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle) [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/)) and attach it to the issue.

Features that require a snapshot with single file:
* Skip intro button
* Skip Credits card/button

any other feature you want added like ads e.g.

ACC: may need to give me an account temporarily to verify its working, because just doing it with the template doesnt show many many bugs.
